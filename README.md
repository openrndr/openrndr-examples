# openrndr-examples

This repository contains runnable examples from the [OPENRNDR guide](https://guide.openrndr.org).

The programs are generated from the documentation sources. In case you run into issues please report them in the [`openrndr-guide`](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-guide) repository

The Gradle build scripts for this project are based on [`openrndr-template`](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template), which is also
the best place to start from when you want to write your own OPENRNDR based programs.

## Usage 

Clone this repository and import in IntelliJ Idea as a Gradle project. 
Individual programs can be run by opening their source files
and clicking on the green wedge shaped icon next to the `main` function.
